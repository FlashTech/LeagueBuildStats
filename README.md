# LeagueBuildStats
A utility that allows you to browse up to date League Of Legends items, champions, abilities, runes, and masteries. Additionally, this utility calculates a variety of stats based on selections made. This utility is currently in pre-alpha not ready for testing and I have a lengthy list of things to program before releasing a major version.
